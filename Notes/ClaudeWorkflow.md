# Recommended Workflow: Cowork → Claude Code Handoff (per Claude.ai)

This is actually **excellent teaching material** for your course!

### The Handoff Pattern

**1. Cowork Phase** (already done)
- Project setup
- Basic structure
- Service layer
- Tests

**2. Claude Code Phase** (next)
- ViewModels
- Calculation services
- Batch file generation
- Test expansion

**3. Xcode Claude Phase**
- UI implementation
- Chart refinement
- Debugging
- Polish

**4. Back to Claude Code**
- Widget implementation
- Build automation
- Final testing

This shows students that **tools can work together** - you don't need to commit to just one!
